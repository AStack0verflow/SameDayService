It is currently 3 AM on Sunday, February 16 and I was just woken up from my sleep by loud gushing water leaking from my ceiling through some cracks in my doorframe between my bedroom and my bathroom. First of all, I am really confused because I'm on the ground floor so I don't know how my ceiling is leaking water but it was enough to wake me up thinking that someone was pouring a glass of water onto my carpet. The amount of water was literally just a pint in volume and then the water stopped coming from my ceiling. I don't know where it came from - due to the rain or to a flood in the apartment above me? I don't know. Right now, I am using an empty trashcan to collect the water in case this happens again while I am sleeping. I hope you guys read these on the weekend so hopefully something can be done today instead of me having to wait until Monday. Please call or email me as soon as you can.

We tried to manually start a cycle on Saturday morning two times, The machine indicated it had begun heat treatment both times, but never kicked in. After a short amount of time another heat cycle failure indicator showed up. It would seem that the heat treatment is not initiating under any circumstances. I wasn't sure if you would want to work on the machine with product or without,so I left it full. Even though we can.t use the product, perhaps we can test the heat treatment cycle with it. Either way, I will be in on Tuesday to clean it.
